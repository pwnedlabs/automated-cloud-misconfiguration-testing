  - name: Detect_Set_IAM_on_Compute_Images
    description:
      The compute.images.setIamPolicy permission was detected. 
      This permission can be used to give an attacker-controlled GCP account read permissions on a compute instance, 
      which may allow exfiltration of the compute image.
    conditions:
      - compute.images.setIamPolicy
